# 110 simple DDA

## Introduction to DDA

* General picture
    * Graphics: Cube -> divided into dipoles
    * each dipole has a polarization and, hence, generates an electric field  (P<sub>i</sub> = &alpha;<sub>i</sub> E(r<sub>i</sub>))
    * which acts on all the other dipoles
    * (trivial solution: all dipoles are zero)
    * but not possible with excitation, e.g. plane wave
    * goal: find the amplitude and orientation of all dipoles

* More formal
    * matrix fields and so on
